1
00:47:45,424 --> 00:47:48,721
In a world where your product,
brand and service are the same as everyone

2
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:52,084
else's, it's only your sales process
that differentiates you.

3
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:55,547
The Challenger sales model.

4
00:47:55,547 --> 00:47:58,211
There's a concept in business
called the North Star Metric.

5
00:47:58,577 --> 00:48:01,907
The North Star metric is the calculation
that drives the company.

6
00:48:02,373 --> 00:48:06,668
In the case of Facebook, their North Star
metric was daily return, average use.

7
00:48:07,168 --> 00:48:10,031
They wanted to optimize for people
returning every day

8
00:48:10,198 --> 00:48:13,428
and using the platform on their way
to monetizing the app.

9
00:48:13,827 --> 00:48:16,291
If you bring the people,
the advertisers will come.

10
00:48:16,558 --> 00:48:18,755
The North Star
metric is a way of framing things.

11
00:48:19,155 --> 00:48:22,618
When you frame something, you cut out
the parts of the image you don't want.

12
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:24,483
Same thing in business.

13
00:48:24,483 --> 00:48:27,879
Arguments are won and lost based
how people define success or frame

14
00:48:27,879 --> 00:48:29,078
the conversation.

15
00:48:29,078 --> 00:48:32,441
So when you're talking in an interview
or in a sales situation,

16
00:48:32,807 --> 00:48:35,937
you want to use the spin methodology
to rank order

17
00:48:35,937 --> 00:48:39,400
a client's problems in terms of cost
saved and impact generated.

18
00:48:39,899 --> 00:48:43,995
Once you've done that, you can determine
the most important metric achieved today

19
00:48:44,628 --> 00:48:49,156
by the need to framing the conversation
in terms of a metric or measurement

20
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:53,118
that you can directly influence,
which addresses a problem worth solving

21
00:48:53,118 --> 00:48:56,382
that generates costs, savings and earnings
impact.

22
00:48:56,881 --> 00:48:59,478
You'll give yourself
the highest chance of probability.
